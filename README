COMPILATION
-----------

1. Compilation of libc

With GCC (tested on Debian GNU/Linux):
$ make CFLAGS="-nostdinc -g -O2" all

2. Compilation of other programs against libc

With GCC (tested on Debian GNU/Linux):
$ make CFLAGS="-W -Wall -ansi -g -O2 -nostdinc -I /usr/local/include/libc" \
    LDFLAGS="-nostdlib -L /usr/local/lib -l c" all
assuming libc headers are accessible in /usr/local/include/libc, and libc
binaries are accessible in /usr/local/lib.
