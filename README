COMPILATION
-----------

1. Compilation of libc

With GCC, this should be enough:
$ make

2. Compilation of other programs against libc

The following instructions assume that the libc was compiled in the
/path/to/libc directory.

With GCC:
$ make CPPFLAGS="-nostdinc -isystem /path/to/libc/include" \
	LDFLAGS="-nostdlib -L/path/to/libc/src -Wl,-rpath,/path/to/libc/src -lc /path/to/libc/src/start.o" \
	target
